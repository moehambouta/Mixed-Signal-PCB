            The ADC subsystem is a crucial element of the board's mixed-signal capabilities, enabling the conversion of analog signals into digital form for further processing. The design features a 14-bit Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC, selected for its high resolution and sample-and-hold capabilities, which are ideal for precision measurements within the audio band.

            The analog front-end consists of an input stage with a BNC connector, facilitating easy and secure connection to external analog sources. This stage is equipped with a PED35D3V3UBA,1.15 ESD protection diode, ensuring the longevity of the device by safeguarding against electrostatic discharge. Additionally, the input passes through a series resistor (RJ300) and an RF filter, which attenuates unwanted high-frequency noise above 1.3 MHz.
        </p>

            The signal is then processed through a buffer amplifier (U300), which uses a MCP6001 operational amplifier known for its rail-to-rail output and low bias currents. The buffer helps to present a low impedance to the subsequent stages and is followed by a high-pass filter to eliminate DC offset and low-frequency drift.
        </p>

            The conditioned signal is finally passed to a third-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 25 kHz. This anti-aliasing filter, implemented using another MCP6001 op-amp (U301), is essential to ensure that the Nyquist criterion is satisfied and to prevent high-frequency signals from aliasing into the passband of interest.
        </p>

            The ADC itself (U303), a ADC14155, is provided with a stable reference voltage (Vref) via a dedicated reference voltage buffer (U302). The Vref is filtered to remove high-frequency noise, assuring the ADC's accuracy and stability. The ADC's power supply is decoupled using capacitors (C314, C315) to minimize noise on the power rails.
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital output from the ADC is interfaced with the microcontroller via an SPI bus, with lines for data output (DOUT), serial clock (SCLK), and chip select (CS). A resistor (R509) ensures the proper selection of the ADC when commanded by the MCU.
