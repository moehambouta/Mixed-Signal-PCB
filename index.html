    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project is a comprehensive showcase of a mixed-signal PCB design, aimed at demonstrating advanced hardware engineering skills in a practical setting.</p>

    <section id="usb">
        <h2>Why USB 2.0?</h2>
        <p>The choice of USB 2.0 is driven by the project's focus on low-frequency applications within the audio band, where high data transfer rates are not crucial. USB 2.0 is sufficient for our needs of data storage and transfer. Additionally, as a bus-powered device, USB Type-C is chosen for its lower power consumption, aligning with the project's efficiency goals.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mcu">
        <h2>Microcontroller Unit (MCU)</h2>
        <p>The chosen MCU suits the project's low-frequency requirements perfectly. The implementation of a Serial Wire Debug (SWD) interface allows for efficient debugging and programming, which is vital for robust hardware development.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="power-supply">
        <h2>Power Supply Design</h2>
        <p>The digital circuitry is powered by a switching supply for its efficiency, while the analog circuitry utilizes an LDO regulator to minimize noise, ensuring high-quality signal processing.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="adc-dac">
        <h2>ADC and DAC Considerations</h2>
        <p>Both the ADC and DAC are designed with ESD protection and anti-aliasing filters to maintain signal integrity. The selection criteria for these components include a minimum of 12-bit width and a sampling rate of 40 kHz. This is in line with the Nyquist theorem, as the maximum frequency in the audio band is 20 kHz, necessitating a minimum sampling rate of double that frequency for accurate signal reproduction.</p>
