        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project entailed the development of a mixed-signal Printed Circuit Board (PCB), beginning with system design and component selection. The process was methodical, focusing on identifying and selecting appropriate parts to meet the design specifications and functional requirements of the PCB.
        </p>
        <p>
            The schematic design was executed using KiCAD 7, allowing for detailed and accurate representation of the electronic circuits. This phase covered critical subsystems including the power supply, Microcontroller Unit (MCU), Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), and Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the schematic design, circuit simulation was performed with LTspice. This step was crucial for verifying the circuit's behavior and ensuring its operational integrity, allowing for adjustments and optimizations prior to physical prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PCB design phase involved the layout and routing of the board, using the schematics as a guide. This stage required careful planning to optimize the placement of components and the routing of traces to ensure functionality and reliability of the final product.
        </p>

            The final step in the design process was the preparation of manufacturing files, specifically Gerber and Drill files. These files are essential for the fabrication of the PCB and represent the culmination of the design and simulation efforts.
