        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project entails the development of a mixed signal PCB, beginning with system design and component selection. The process was methodical, focusing on identifying and selecting appropriate parts to meet the design specifications and functional requirements of the PCB.</p>

        <h3>Required Specifications: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>STM32F103C8T6 MCU</li>
            <li>USB 2.0 FS Communication</li>
            <li>Switching regulator: TLV62569DBV</li>
            <li>LDO regulator: HT7533-1</li>
            <li>ADC141S626CIMM/NOPB - 14 bits, 50 kSPS to 250 kSPS, differential</li>
            <li>DAC7563SDGSR - 12 bits, single-ended</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The STM32F103C8T6 MCU is chosen for its widespread use, low power requirement, and compatibility with USB 2.0 FS, ensured through an SPI interface. The MCU's flash and RAM capacities are well-suited for the project's demands.</p>
        <p>Power considerations are crucial, with digital components requiring up to 250mA and analog parts up to 50mA. A dual-regulator system is implemented to accommodate these needs efficiently.</p>
        <p>The TLV62569DBV switching regulator is tasked with converting the +5V input to +3.3V for digital circuits, chosen for its high efficiency and optimal switching frequency. The HT7533-I LDO regulator caters to the analog supply with a minimal voltage differential, catering to low noise requirements.</p>
        <p>Lastly, the ADC and DAC are selected for their single-channel capabilities, adequate resolution, and SPI communication compatibility, rounding off the PCB's design to cover the full audio spectrum.</p>
        <p>The completion of this project was made possible through a comprehensive course by Phil's Lab, which provided a foundational understanding and practical skills in hardware design. A special thanks to the course for guiding the project from concept to reality.
