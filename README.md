# Mixed Signal PCB Project

This repository contains all the source files for the Mixed Signal PCB Project, an endeavor to design and develop a PCB capable of signal generation and analysis within the audio band. The project is thoroughly documented through a series of blog posts available at [Mixed Signal PCB Project Blog](https://moehambouta.github.io/Mixed-Signal-PCB).

## Repository Structure

- `Assembly` - Contains the bill of materials and assembly information.
- `Components` - Individual component files used in the design.
- `Gerber` - Gerber files necessary for PCB manufacturing.
- `Media` - Images and videos showcasing the PCB and its design process.
- `PCB` - The KiCAD PCB design file.
- `Schematics` - Schematic files for each section of the PCB design.

## Website Branch

The `website` branch hosts the HTML, CSS, and image files for the project's [web presentation](https://moehambouta.github.io/Mixed-Signal-PCB).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and explore the `Schematics` and `PCB` folders to view and modify the design files using KiCAD.
