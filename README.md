# Mixed Signal Hardware Design Project

The Mixed Signal Hardware Design Project features a PCB designed for dual functionality as both a signal generator and analyzer within the audio frequency spectrum. It serves as a practical example of embedded system design and mixed-signal processing.

Check out the [3D model presentation video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moehambouta/Mixed-Signal-PCB/main/assets/3d_model.mp4) to see the project in action.
