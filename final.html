        <h2>Next Steps: Manufacturing and Experimentation</h2>
        <p>
            With the design phase of the project successfully concluded, the immediate next step is to proceed with manufacturing. The PCB design has been finalized, and the corresponding Gerber and Drill files have been meticulously prepared, ensuring they adhere to the requisite specifications for production. The manufacturing process will be commissioned with a chosen PCB fabrication house, translating the detailed blueprints into a tangible, functional hardware board.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon receipt of the manufactured PCBs, the focus will shift to hands-on experimentation and testing. This stage is crucial for verifying the design in real-world conditions, assessing the board's performance, and confirming that it meets the intended functional requirements. Activities will include populating the board with components, soldering, and conducting initial power-up tests followed by extensive functional testing.
        </p>

            The experimentation phase will also involve developing and refining firmware that interfaces with the board's capabilities. Although the design is expected to function as intended, this phase allows for exploring the full operational range of the board, tweaking parameters, and optimizing performance based on empirical data.
        </p>
        <p>
            In parallel with technical testing, there will be opportunities for creative exploration, utilizing the board as a signal generator and analyzer, and implementing it in various practical applications. This experiential phase is not only a testament to the project's success but also an invaluable learning experience, providing insights that can inform future projects.
